# Zsh Config
My Zsh config

## Installation
Clone the `zsh-config` into your config folder.
```sh
git clone --recurse-submodules https://github.com/notfirefox/zsh-config.git $HOME/.config/zsh
```

Now you just need to source the `init.zsh` file from your `.zshrc` file.
```sh
echo 'source "$HOME/.config/zsh/init.zsh"' > $HOME/.zshrc
```
