# Zsh Config
Minimal Zsh Config

## Installation
Clone the repository into your config folder.
```sh
git clone "https://github.com/notfirefox/zsh-config.git" "$HOME/.config/zsh"
```

Now you just need to source the `init.zsh` file from your `.zshrc` file.
```sh
echo 'source "$HOME/.config/zsh/init.zsh"' > "$HOME/.zshrc"
```
